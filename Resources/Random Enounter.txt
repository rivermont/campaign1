PCs are walking down a path into a thick forest. The path fades as they travel further in. On the
outskirts of the forest, there were a few small animals - squirrels, rabbits etc. - but slowly the
forest gets darker and the animals disappear. Passive Perception 12 or higher lets the PC know that
the party is being watched.
The trees around them are hollow, and elves are watching from inside. Ents slowly close in from
behind, blocking off the path. The PCs can either try to negotiate with the elves or fight.
