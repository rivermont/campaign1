travel 1 day and are attacked that night be kobolds. If they defeat the kobolds, the hear a squeak
and see a puff of smoke from a nearby tree that one of the kobolds climbed. They find a baby
dragon, and if a PC makes a successful DC 15 Nature check, the dragon climbs onto their head and
becomes an ally of the party.
