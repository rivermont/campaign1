The PCs find an old, seemingly deserted ruin of a small tower. DC 15 Dungeoneering or Perception
check to find a stash of food. The stash has some old wine, a few stable loaves of breed abd 2 days
worth of trail rations. Roll a d20; on a roll of 17-20, the PCs spot a foraging party returning.
These parties consist of two kobold minions and one kobold tunneler. Roll another d20 for every
hour the PCs stay above ground. The PCs find a trapdoor covered in rocks near the base of the
watchtower. A ladder leads down to a cellar, and behind some barrels of water they find a small set
of stairs leading down to the dungeon.
